                    Portland, Oregon we're going to take you on an exciting journey through some unknown regions of your
                    country. Leave the car at home and travel by bike starting in New England where it all began. You
                    will pass through 12 beautiful states, covering a total of 3,600 miles, and accomplish 3 monumental
                    missions. Partying and taking a selfie with a famous rock star, donating $1 to a billionaire to help
                    eradicate polio in Africa, and even stopping by famous author Stephen King's house to say hi and
                    asking him to sign your favorite book.

                                These boots are also better than cycling shoes when pitching a tent.
